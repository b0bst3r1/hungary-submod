His enemy, though numerous in men and firepower, is still weak. A well placed blow will easily dismantle the solid-looking structure, like a house removed its foundations.\n\nThe revolutionary must, then, use his small numbers in his own favour. Where trucks and trains cannot travel, he hides, living in the forested valleys and rugged terrain. His small numbers mean his diet can be sustained easily by remaining rations and wild game.\n\nThen, when the moment arises, he leaves his stronghold to engage with his foes below. Never directly attacking, he picks off his enemies at a distance. A sniper takes out a lone patrolman, a trapper cripples a scout: the revolutionary fighter must take the mindset he is hunting and stalking his enemy like he would any other animal, as he slowly withers their forces away through constant battles of attrition.”."

It is for this reason that these vices must be eliminated, to complete the social revolution and completely free the working classes from their chains.\n\nEffective immediately, all bars will be closed and transformed into “worker’s clubs”.

He was imprisoned in the Eger Castle for seven years, not even learning why until his second year there. During his imprisonment he ground a small passageway into a neighboring cell and befriended a wealthy Austrian priest named Father Alois who was also held in the fortress. A year later, a dying Alois bequeathed to Tóth a treasure he had hidden in Wien. When Tóth was released he took possession of the treasure, returned under another name to Pest and spent 10 years plotting revenge against his former friends.\n\nTóth first murdered Szabó or had him murdered. Tóth's former fiancée had, two years after his disappearance, married his former friend Ferenc, who became the subject of his most brutal revenge. Tóth tricked Ferenc's daughter into marrying a criminal, whom he then had arrested. Ferenc's daughter promptly died of shock. Tóth then burned down Ferenc's restaurant, or arranged to have it burned down, leaving Ferenc impoverished. Next, he fatally poisoned Máté and either manipulated Ferenc's son into stealing some gold jewelry or framed him for committing the crime. The boy was sent to jail, and Tóth stabbed Ferenc to death. He was himself then abducted by a vengeful Allut, who seriously injured Tóth while holding him captive.
