  ROM_translyvanian_resistance_desc:0 "The Transylvanian Red Front is an extreme left-wing, illegal paramilitary organisation funded by the Hungarian Jacobin Party. Its aim is for Transylvania to gain independence and/or join Hungary. It tries to achieve this through terrorist attacks on the police, illegal demonstrations, etc. \n\nAlso under the leadership of the Red Front there are organisations like the Union of Free Transylvanian Youth and the Fighting Red Sports Society."  
  ROM_russian_rule:0 "Russian Rule"
  ROM_russian_rule_desc:0 "After the unification of the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia into a single state in 1859, Domnitor Alexandru Ioan I came up against an enemy worse than the strongest Ottoman or Russian armies: politicians. Alienated by his sweeping reforms, a “monstrous coalition” of landowners and businessmen formed against him, demanding his abdication. This conflict came to a head as an economic crisis led to an attempted coup d’etat. While the coup failed, this brought the Domnitor’s attention to his opposition. With shrewd diplomacy, he was able to secure the support of both Britain and France, insisting that his downfall would lead to Romania falling back into the waiting hands of Russia or the Ottomans.\n\nWhile he managed to keep his nation independent in his own life, the same could not be said of his successor. His young son “Sasa” Cuza was crowned Alexandru Ioan II after his death in 1873, and the boy failed to meet the expectations set up by his father. The new Domnitor was impotent, sickly, and easily manipulated by his peers. As he reached adulthood, he favored the Conservatives heavily over the National Liberals in power since the time of his father, severing ties with Britain and France and instead making overtures to the Russian Emperor.\n\nHis sudden death in 1890 left Romania vulnerable, even more so due to the fact that Sasa had no legitimate heir since the death of his younger brother Dimitrie. His government discovered, to their shock, that the late Domnitor had left his title and nation to Alexander III of Russia. A liberal nationalist coalition hastily took control by force and desperately searched for a European house willing to replace the Cuzas, but to no avail. The brief reign of the Regents was swept away by a Russian army, and Romania became yet another client state of the Empire. The capital was officially placed in Iași in order to appeal to the Moldavian boyar class, and appointed a namestnik to govern locally.\n\n§RSooner or later the Danubian principalities will regain their independence and punish all oppressors.§!"
  ROM_political_turmoil:0 "Political Turmoil"
  ROM_political_turmoil_desc:0 "Romania is a nation in turmoil. Political chaos in Russia has led to a resurgence of the National Liberals and other opposition movements, and the entire nation seems up for grabs. As the political crisis in Russia worsens, Romania is drifting more and more towards independence. These movements are gaining more and more popularity.\n\n§RThe Second “Monstrous Coalition”§!: \n\nThe §BThe National Liberals.§! support Romania’s local bourgeoisie over the traditional elites and represent the largest anti-Russian faction. While they are pragmatically aligned with the Romanian left against the Russian administration, they still heavily oppose socialist policies, especially Rakovsky’s group of radicals.\n\n§OThe Peasant’s Party§! remains the largest faction of the left in Romania, and their brand of agrarian populism (often referred to as “Poporanism”) has gained support among the rural poor.\n\n§CRakovsky’s Central Republican Committee§! is the most radical of the anti-Russian factions, and it fully supports Hungary’s socialist bloc. While Rakovsky’s fiery calls for revolution have made him popular among peasants and workers, his unwillingness to compromise with moderates may prove dangerous. The CCR’s actions of terrorism against the state are infamous, and often used by the administration to demonize the Romanian left.\n\n§GThe Organic Administration:§!\n\nWhile we are in a good position to thwart the socialists and traitors, change is still necessary to restore order. The §HConservative Party§! will keep the nation on the proper course, with some reform to keep our rivals sated.\n\n§PPeople’s Nationalist Party§! began as a splinter from the Conservatives demanding economic and land reform, under Cuza it has become something unique, a synthesis of socialism, ultranationalism, and agrarian populism."
  ROM_religious_divide:0 "Religious Divide"
  ROM_religious_divide_desc:0 "Religiously the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia is divided into two different sides: Orthodox Moldavia and Catholic Wallachia, actively funded by Catholic Habsburg Germany. Despite all attempts by Russia to extend Orthodoxy to Wallachia, nothing worked. Onn the contrary, it triggered a new phase of regional conflicts in the region.\n\nThe only chance of stability in the Danubian principalities is the establishment of a full-fledged secular state to put a definitive end to all religious disputes. But this is actively opposed by foreign powers which, by supporting allied movements earn influence in the state."
  ROM_peasantry:0 "A Danubian life is a Peasants life"
  ROM_peasantry_desc:0 "While constant government efforts were made to modernize and industrialize UPMW, almost 80% of its population keeps consisting of peasantry and a huge chunk of the economy remains dependant on the agricultural sector. While this has helped country in some forms and protected it during the economic crashes across Eastern Europe in the wake of the Great War, it continues to limit state's economic capabilities and will not be able to support the needs of a modern, mechanized army."

  PB_ROM_Alexander_Averescu_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 09/03/1859\n\nAlexandru Averescu was born in Babele, United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia a village northwest of Izmail (Izmayil). The son of Constantin Averescu, who held the rank of sluger, he studied at the Romanian Orthodox seminary in Izmail, then at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bucharest (intending to become an engineer).In 1876, he decided to join the Gendarmes in Izmail. He received a military education in Wallachia, at the military school of Târgoviște, and in Italy, at the Military Academy of Turin.\n\nAdvancing rapidly up the military ladder, he became head of the Bucharest Military Academy in 1889, which helped him greatly in the future. In 1890, during the intervention of the Russian Empire, he supported the interventionists and even used his influence to lend them military support by raising a local uprising in Bucharest. Appreciating this support, Averescu became Minister of Defense of the new Danubian state, and Alexandru Cernat became the so-called Namestnik. In 1900, at the age of 41, he became the first Marshal of the United Danubian Principalities.\n\nIn 1905, during the Great War, Alexandru Cernat, the first namestnik of the United Danubian Principalities, died of old age. Wishing to preserve the steadfastness of the army, Russia decides to appoint Alexandru Averescu as the new leader of the state.\n\nIn 1922 local nationalist uprisings began throughout the Russian Empire. Romania was also under threat of revolt, but with a firm hand, the army under Averescu swept away all nationalist movements. After 2 years Under diplomatic pressure from Germany, Russia acedes to some of the demands of the nationalist revolutionaries, including the city of Izmail, to ensure maximum loyalty of the United Danubian Principalities.\n\nToday Alexandru Averescu is the old leader, fulfilling the wishes of the Russian Empire, all losing and losing his former influence in the army. While in the political sphere, The National Liberals are slowly gaining more and more political power."
