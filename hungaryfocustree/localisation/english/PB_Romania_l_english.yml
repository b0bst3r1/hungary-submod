  ROM_russian_rule_desc:0 "After the unification of the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia into a single state in 1859, Domnitor Alexandru Ioan I came up against an enemy worse than the strongest Ottoman or Russian armies: politicians. Alienated by his sweeping reforms, a “monstrous coalition” of landowners and businessmen formed against him, demanding his abdication. This conflict came to a head as an economic crisis led to an attempted coup d’etat. While the coup failed, this brought the Domnitor’s attention to his opposition. With shrewd diplomacy, he was able to secure the support of both Britain and France, insisting that his downfall would lead to Romania falling back into the waiting hands of Russia or the Ottomans.\n\nWhile he managed to keep his nation independent in his own life, the same could not be said of his successor. His young son “Sasa” Cuza was crowned Alexandru Ioan II after his death in 1873, and the boy failed to meet the expectations set up by his father. The new Domnitor was impotent, sickly, and easily manipulated by his peers. As he reached adulthood, he favored the Conservatives heavily over the National Liberals in power since the time of his father, severing ties with Britain and France and instead making overtures to the Russian Emperor.\n\nHis sudden death in 1890 left Romania vulnerable, even more so due to the fact that Sașa had no legitimate heir since the death of his younger brother Dimitrie. His government discovered, to their shock, that the late Domnitor had left his title and nation to Alexander III of Russia. A liberal nationalist coalition hastily took control by force and desperately searched for a European house willing to replace the Cuzas, but to no avail. The brief reign of the Regents was swept away by a Russian army, and Romania became yet another client state of the Empire. The capital was officially placed in Iași in order to appeal to the Moldavian boyar class, and appointed a namestnik to govern locally.\n\n§RSooner or later the Danubian principalities will regain their independence and punish all oppressors.§!"

  ROM_political_turmoil_desc:0 "Romania is a nation in turmoil. Political chaos in Russia has led to a resurgence of the National Liberals and other opposition movements, and the entire nation seems up for grabs. As the political crisis in Russia worsens, Romania is drifting more and more towards independence. Movements for independence from Russia are gaining more and more popularity.\n\n §RThe Second “Monstrous Coalition”:§! \n\n§BThe National Liberals.§! support Romania’s local bourgeoisie over the traditional elites and represent the largest anti-Russian faction. They also have a choice to either find a new monarch or establish a liberal republic.\n\n§OThe Peasant’s Party§! remains the largest faction of the left in Romania, and their brand of agrarian populism (often referred to as “Poporanism”) has gained support among the rural poor.\n\n§GThe Organic Administration:§!\n\n Though the new “monstrous coalition” has been thwarted, swift action is still necessary to maintain the stability of the Romanian state. §HConstantin Prezan§! will keep the nation on the proper course, with some reform to keep our rivals sated.\n\nWhile the §PPeople’s Nationalist Party§! began as a splinter from the Conservatives demanding economic and land reform, under Cuza it has become something unique, a synthesis of socialism, ultranationalism, and agrarian populism."
  ROM_religious_divide:0 "Religious Divide"
  ROM_religious_divide_desc:0 "Religiously the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia is divided into two different sides: Orthodox Moldavia and Catholic Wallachia, actively funded by Catholic Habsburg Germany. Despite all attempts by Russia to extend Orthodoxy to Wallachia, nothing worked. Onn the contrary, it triggered a new phase of regional conflicts in the region.\n\nThe only chance of stability in the Danubian principalities is the establishment of a full-fledged secular state to put a definitive end to all religious disputes. But this is actively opposed by foreign powers which, by supporting allied movements earn influence in the state."
  ROM_peasantry:0 "A Danubian life is a Peasants life"
  ROM_peasantry_desc:0 "While constant government efforts were made to modernize and industrialize UPMW, almost 80% of its population keeps consisting of peasantry and a huge chunk of the economy remains dependant on the agricultural sector. While this has helped country in some forms and protected it during the economic crashes across Eastern Europe in the wake of the Great War, it continues to limit state's economic capabilities and will not be able to support the needs of a modern, mechanized army."
