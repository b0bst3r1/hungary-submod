On a single order, the military marched into every city of the state and moved on all government buildings. Those hitherto supporting the revolutionary government were immediately arrested, while the top leadership was summarily executed. As the fascist street thugs have began to vandalize undesirablle properties, as political violence steadily worsens\n\nThe conservative military, after a brief debate, decided to declare a Regency Council until the right monarch, Habsburg or possibly someone else, could be found for Hungary. With such radical ideas and a dramatic change of course, Hungary will undoubtedly experience great turmoil in the coming months."
