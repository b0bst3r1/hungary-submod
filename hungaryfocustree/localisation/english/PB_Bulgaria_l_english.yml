  PB_BUL_Nikolay_II_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 30/12/1876\n\n Nikolay II Dadiani is a representative of a Georgian noble family that began its history in 1191. He has been in power in Bulgaria for more than 25 years and until recently his power was mainly held by the presence of a large Russian garrison, but now that it have practically left Bulgaria the Tsarist power is beginning to crumble.\n\nSince Russia did not have the resources to industrialize Bulgaria during the 56 years of the Dadiani dynasty, the country has not made significant progress, this is what critics and opposition figures pay attention to. In the face of the global economic crisis Bulgarians are rapidly getting poorer and the society is asking for significant reforms, which probably the current government is incapable of carry out, so people are turning to leftist ideas - socialists or even the Jacobins.\n\n§RIt seems that the Tsarist regime in Bulgaria is coming to an end...§!"

IMRO has a reputation as a terrorist network that seeks to change state borders in the Macedonian regions of Greece and Serbia. They carry out raids from their stronghold in Petrich into Greek and Serbian territory.\n\nWe are secretly investing resources as well as encouraging people to join this organisation in order to bring closer the undoubtedly inevitable reunification of the Bulgarian people of Macedonia and Thrace."

We have repeatedly justified this title during numerous Balkan feuds, as well as in battles with the Ottoman Empire. From the looks of things, we will soon have to prove this title again."
  BUL_rus_influence:0 "Fading Influence of Russia"
  BUL_rus_influence_desc:0 "Way back in 1877 when Bulgaria, after several hundred years of Ottoman Oppression, was finally able to gain its independence with the huge help of the Russian Empire. Accordingly, a few weeks after independence Russia took advantage of its great influence in Bulgaria and demanded install §HGeorgian noble Niko Dadiani§! as Leader. Bulgaria had no choice but to agree after all that the Russian Empire had done for us. Immediately after the establishment of a friendly monarchy in the country, Russia sent its troops in to defend the new regime. In fact Bulgaria became another client state of the Huge Empire.\n\nNow that Russia is in the throes of a political crisis, the Empire's influence on Bulgaria is getting weaker and weaker. There is virtually nothing left of the large contingent of Russians, with the consequence that it has little or no influence over the Tsardom despite its formal status as Imperial Autonomy.\n\nAt the same time, tensions between Russia's allies continue to grow. Romania is increasingly laying claim to North Dobruja (a region handed over to Bulgaria immediately after independence), while the Tsardom is claiming to the Greek territories of Thrace and to the Serbian territories of Macedonia."

  BUL_unpopular_tsar_desc:0 "Nikolay I Dadiani became king of Bulgaria on 6 August 1877 at the request of the Russian Empire. His regime, like that of his successor Nikolay II, was kept in check by a Russian garrison which stopped any attempts at protest. When the Russian garrison left Bulgaria almost entirely, Dadiani's monarchy was left in great threat.\n\nFor three years now the Bulgarian regime has miraculously held on, but this may soon be over. Opposition movements are rapidly gaining strength and are already threatening the Tsarist regime right now.\n\nOne of the proposed leaders of the new Bulgaria is also from the Dadiani family, but despite his kinship, the socialist  §OShalva Dadiani§!, who holds opposition views. Also one of the candidates is the leader of the §CLiberal Party of Bulgaria Alexander Girkinov§!, who advocates close cooperation with Britain and Germany.\n\n§RBulgaria is in a precarious position and no one knows what will happen to it in the near future.§!"

  hungary.21.d:0 "The Bulgarian monarchy seems to be going under. Nicholas II has been tsar of Bulgaria for almost 30 years and has recently come under great criticism from the opposition, resulting in his popularity among the people. In recent weeks, angry people have taken to the streets demanding radical social reforms and the abolition of absolute monarchy. Nicholas II could not resist the onslaught and abdicated the throne.\n\nShalva Dadiani took over, social reforms were immediately instituted, and a constitutional monarchy was established. The overthrow of the former monarchy effectively meant the fall of Russian rule over Bulgaria, but Russia's response had not yet been forthcoming."
