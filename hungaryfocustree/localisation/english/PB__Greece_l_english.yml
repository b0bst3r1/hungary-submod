 GRE_second_rome_desc:0 "As a result of the Aegean Treaty, Greece gained control of Constantinople for the first time after a break of more than 350 years. The so-called Second Rome was once again in the hands of its rightful owners, the Orthodox Greeks. It was definitely worth it, even though in exchange Greece gave up the rights to a semi-permanent Russian military presence, also Russia gained almost complete economic dominance in the Greek military-industrial complex and de facto control of the Bosporus Strait. \n\n§RHistorical justice prevailed.§!"
