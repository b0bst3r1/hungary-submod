 GRE_second_rome_desc:0 "As a result of the Aegean Treaty, Greece gained control of Constantinople for the first time after a break of more than 350 years. The so-called Second Rome was once again in the hands of its rightful owners, the Orthodox Greeks. And this despite the fact that in exchange for this Greece gave up the rights to a semi-permanent Russian military presence, also almost complete economic dominance of Russia in the Greek military-industrial complex and the empire's de facto control of the Bosporus Strait, it was definitely worth it. \n\n§RHistorical justice prevailed.§!"
