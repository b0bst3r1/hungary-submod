  HUN_Croatian_Support:0 "Supporting Croatian Rebels"
  HUN_Croatian_Support_desc:0 "The Great War's aftermath saw the §BKingdom of the Dinaric§!, an artificial German protectorate, collapse into ethnic and political violence. Citing Hungary's claims on Croatia, the Hungarian Revolutionary Army moved in to openly support Croatian forces in the region in 1914. This saw the establishment of the §RCroatian People's Republic, a sister Republic§! to the one in Budapest and heavily reliant on local Hungarian advisors and economic support. A significant portion of our military is dedicated to supporting the Croatian forces, drawing some resources away from other sectors." 
  HUN_diverse_general_staff:0 "Diverse General Staff"
  HUN_diverse_general_staff_desc:0 "Hungarian General Staff is made up of representatives of various political views ranging from §RJacobinism§! to §GRadical Nationalism§!. Although Jacobinism is against nationalism and believes in internationalism Hungary cannot repress such Generals, as this would be a huge blow to the whole army. Also many militaries take the position of §BState Socialism§! and do not support the current party line advocating the introduction of market reforms. \n\n§RAll this is incredibly divide for the Hungarian Common Republic and calls into question its existence.§!" 
  BOS_patriotic_war:0 "Bosnian Patriotic War"
  BOS_patriotic_war_desc:0 "Bosnia has been under the control of foreign goverments for centuries. The people have been enslaved by foreign overlords. Turkey, Serbia, Croatia and, until recently, Hungary did not allow the Bosnian people to live freely. \n\nNow that Bosnia is finally independent, the invaders are encroaching on Bosnian territory again. This is an ideal chance for the Bosnian people. We must not find ourselves again under foreign domination. \n\n§RThere can be no peaceful coexistence between the Islamic faith and non-Islamic society and political institutions.§!" 
  BUL_balkan_union:0 "Balkan Union"
  BUL_balkan_union_desc:0 "The Balkan Union is a regional integration association of Balkan Countries. The objectives of the BU is a customs Union, a common agricultural policy, free movement of capital, labour and services between member states."
  HUN_red_terror:0 "Red Terror"
  HUN_red_terror_desc:0 "We must get rid of all unfaithful people who do not follow the true path of the revolution. They bring only harm to the country and do not contribute to progress towards a bright future."
  ROM_translyvanian_resistance:0 "Red Front of Transylvania"
  ROM_translyvanian_resistance_desc:0 "The Transylvanian Red Front is an extreme left-wing, illegal paramilitary organisation funded by the Hungarian Jacobin Party. Its aim is for Transylvania to gain independence and/or join Hungary. It tries to achieve this through terrorist attacks on the police, illegal demonstrations, etc. \n\nAlso under the leadership of the Red Front there are organisations like the Union of Free Transylvanian Youth and the Fighting Red Sports Society."
  HUN_United_Country:0 "United Country"
  HUN_United_Country_desc:0 "Despite all the difficulties that followed the 1911 revolution, the Hungarian Jacobin Party succeeded in establishing all Hungarian-populated areas, or so-called natural borders of Hungary. \n\n§GEvery Hungarian can now sleep in peace!§!"
  PB_HUN_Revolution_Home:0 "Home of the Revolution"
  PB_HUN_Revolution_Home_desc:0 "§RThe Hungarian People's Republic is the only major revolutionary republic in existence in continental Europe and, if the reactionary powers had their way, it would be the last.§! \n\nFollowing the Great War, Hungary found itself in crisis. Their allegiance to Germany had cost nearly a million lives, economic collapse and reduced much of the nation to near famine conditions. The touchpaper of Revolution was easily lit in 1912, when the Royal Hungarian Army attempted to crack down on protests in Budapest.\n\nVeteran's militias, trained and hardened by fighting on the Romanian and North Italian fronts, quickly turned the tables on the pro-German protectorate government. Within a matter of days, the nation descended into civil war and revolutionary violence. The regime that emerged from the revolution would be one founded not on Imperial obligations or bourgeois capitalism, but on revolutionary republicanism. Hungary is the vanguard of the revolution in the Balkans, and her people are dedicated to the ideas upon which the new republic was founded."
  PB_HUN_Ethnic_Tensions:0 "Ethnic Tensions"
  PB_HUN_Ethnic_Tensions_desc:0 "§RIt feels like the Republic is threatened by all sides even from the inside.§! \n\nIn recent years the Non-Hungarian Groups in the Republic have become more and more unruly. Enemy Spies are catched stirring up Anti-Hungarian Propaganda, weapons are smuggled over the borders and the children do not sing the anthem properly anymore. Especially in Slovakia the situation is growing out of control. It seems like the Magyarization Policies towards the Slovaks might dangerously backfire."
  PB_HUN_Collapsing_Government:0 "Collapsing Government"
  PB_HUN_Collapsing_Government_desc:0 "The Government of §RVilmos Böhm§! is beginning to crack. Böhm has led the young republic through its destabilizing crises and greatest pinnacles, but it appears his time is coming to an end. The two main branches of the §RForradalmi Tanacs (FT)§!) the §BReformists§! and §GVanguardists§! are more and more unable to peacefully work together with each other. Vilmos efforts of the last 13 years to unite the two branches do not seem to bear any fruits any more. Vilmos is becoming more and more tired of politics. For 13 Years he has led the young republic but now it maybe needs a new direction."
