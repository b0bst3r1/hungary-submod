This saw the establishment of the §RCroatian People's Republic, a sister Republic§! to the one in Budapest and heavily reliant on local Hungarian advisors and economic support.

  HUN_diverse_general_staff:0 "Diverse General Staff"
  HUN_diverse_general_staff_desc:0 "Hungarian General Staff is made up of representatives of various political views ranging from §RJacobinism§! to §GRadical Nationalism§!. Although Jacobinism is against nationalism and believes in internationalism Hungary cannot repress such Generals, as this would be a huge blow to the whole army. Also many militaries take the position of §BState Socialism§! and do not support the current party line advocating the introduction of market reforms. \n\n§RAll this is incredibly divide for the Hungarian Common Republic and calls into question its existence.§!" 
  BOS_patriotic_war:0 "Bosnian Patriotic War"
  BOS_patriotic_war_desc:0 "Bosnia has been under the control of foreign goverments for centuries. The people have been enslaved by foreign overlords. Turkey, Serbia, Croatia and, until recently, Hungary did not allow the Bosnian people to live freely. \n\nNow that Bosnia is finally independent, the invaders are encroaching on Bosnian territory again. This is an ideal chance for the Bosnian people. We must not find ourselves again under foreign domination. \n\n§RThere can be no peaceful coexistence between the Islamic faith and non-Islamic society and political institutions.§!"

Their allegiance to Germany had cost nearly a million lives, economic collapse and reduced much of the nation to near famine conditions. The touchpaper of Revolution was easily lit in 1912, when the Royal Hungarian Army attempted to crack down on protests in Budapest.\n\nVeteran's militias, trained and hardened by fighting on the Romanian and North Italian fronts, quickly turned the tables on the pro-German protectorate government. Within a matter of days, the nation descended into civil war and revolutionary violence. The regime that emerged from the revolution would be one founded not on Imperial obligations or bourgeois capitalism, but on revolutionary republicanism. Hungary is the vanguard of the revolution in the Balkans, and her people are dedicated to the ideas upon which the new republic was founded."

  PB_HUN_Ethnic_Tensions_desc:0 "§RIt feels like the Republic is threatened by all sides even from the inside.§! \n\nIn recent years the Non-Hungarian Groups in the Republic have become more and more unruly. Enemy Spies are catched stirring up Anti-Hungarian Propaganda, weapons are smuggled over the borders and the children do not sing the anthem properly anymore. Especially in Slovakia the situation is growing out of control. It seems like the Magyarization Policies towards the Slovaks might dangerously backfire."
  PB_HUN_Collapsing_Government:0 "Collapsing Government"
  PB_HUN_Collapsing_Government_desc:0 "The Government of §RVilmos Böhm§! is beginning to crack. Böhm has led the young republic through its destabilizing crises and greatest pinnacles, but it appears his time is coming to an end. The two main branches of the §RForradalmi Tanacs (FT)§!) the §BReformists§! and §GVanguardists§! are more and more unable to peacefully work together with each other. Vilmos efforts of the last 13 years to unite the two branches do not seem to bear any fruits any more. Vilmos is becoming more and more tired of politics.

The personal property of the family remained the dwelling house with a small plot of land, one cow, up to a dozen small animals and poultry. Although every member of the commune was a co-owner, the result of activities was divided according to the contribution of labour without taking into account corporate rights (property share, share). The work done was often not valued in money, but in labour time - labour days, which were added up and formed the share due to the worker in the distribution of production and income at the end of the agricultural production cycle."
