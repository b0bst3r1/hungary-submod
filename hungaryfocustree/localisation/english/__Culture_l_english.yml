It began back in the Kingdom of Hungary, but reached its peak after the revolution, when Slovaks, Croats, Ruthenians, Wallachians and even some people from other countries came to Budapest seeing it as the only possibility for their lives. Of the total population of Budapest, only 65% are Hungarians, which clearly affects the cultural development of the city."
