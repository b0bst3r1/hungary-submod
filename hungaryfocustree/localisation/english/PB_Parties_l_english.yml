 NI_VARIANT_01:0 "§ONew Imperialists§!"
 NI_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§ONeo-Imperialism§! is less of a unified ideology and more a set of similar principles shared by different groups. While 19th Century Imperialism was born out of the mission to civilize and a need for resources, New Imperialism was born out of the cultural chaos of the Great War's aftermath.\n\nUnlike a conventional dictatorial system, Neo-Imperialism advocates for the grand expansion of the state to dominate their neighbors both culturally, economically and politically. The concept of cultural dominance is particularly prevalent, as Neo-Imperialists believe in the inherent superiority of their home culture, and often see other cultures as inferior. This often extends to the topic of race, with Neo-Imperialists advocating for obliteration of so-called savage cultures and identities. Though there are naturally variances, Neo-Imperialists are almost invariably violent expansionists with aims on their neighbors and the world at large."

 NI_VARIANT_02:0 "§OUltranationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§OUltranationalism§! is a form of extreme nationalism focusing on the importance of one state or racial group above all others. Unlike Neo-Imperialism, Ultranationalism is not couched in Victorian concepts of racial superiority. Instead, it focuses on a xenophobic distrust of other races, seeking to eliminate them alltogether rather than forcefully assimilate them. Many ultranationalists hold a mythologized view of their national history, drawing on ancient or even mythical origin stories to build an extremist mythology around their people."

 NI_VARIANT_03:0 "§ONational Syndicalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§ONational Syndicalism§! is a form of left-wing extreme nationalism intended to fuse the nationalist struggle and class struggle. Under National Syndicalism, Trade Unions are often a key aspect of the integral national struggle. It disregards concepts like democratization or reformism in favour of reactionary political policies combined with mildly progressive social policies. In many cases, the means of production are concentrated in the hands of the state, rather than the proletariat."

 NI_VARIANT_04:0 "§OClerical Ultranationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§OClerical Ultranationalism§! is, as the name implies, a synthesis of religious dogma and ultranationalist reactionary doctrine. The church, or alternate religious equivalent, holds major value as an organ of the nationalist state. Dogma is a principle motivating factor in government decisions, but not the sole factor as typical nationalist ideology still holds considerable sway."

 NI_VARIANT_05:0 "§ORevolutionary Nationalism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§ORevolutionary Nationalism§! is a combination of Revolutionary Republicanist ideas and ultranationalist doctrine. Birthed during the tumultous interwar years of the French Republic, Revolutionary Nationalism was first described by French thinker Georges Sorel. He argued for taking the revolutionary republicanist aspect of Jacobinism and combining it with a strong, militaristic reactionary state. In recent years, the ideology has been pushed by French Armandists, their titular idealogue being former Jacobin Inessa Armand. "

 NI_VARIANT_06:0 "§ONeo-Colonialism§!"
 NI_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "§ONeo-Colonialism§! refers to a particularly ultranationalist variant of imperial colonialism. Rather than merely lording over the colonized groups, Neo-Colonialist regimes seek to actively impose their culture and hierarchy on these foreign groups.\n\nAs an ideology, Neo-Colonialism is a relatively recent invention. The political radicalization of countries like France have created new strains of imperial ideological thought, including Neo-Colonialism. The ideology has primarily gained traction in the Green Sahara colonies, where Europeanization is still maintained in full."

 DS_VARIANT_01:0 "§ODespotists§!"
 DS_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§ODespotism§! is a blanket ideology often ascribed to dictatorships, absolute monarchies and other right-wing authoritarian states. Though they can very wildly in domestic and foreign policy, despotic regimes will always do everything in their power to crush domestic threats to their power.\n\nThese regimes are often extremely militaristic, focusing on a mixture of reactionary values and propaganda to encourage an almost fanatically loyal population, or, at the very least, a population unwilling to openly challenge their dictates."
 
 DS_VARIANT_02:0 "§OAbsolutism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§OAbsolutism§! is an overarching ideology to describe nations where a hereditary monarch holds complete power over the entire government. While there may be individuals in an advisory role, an absolutist government will always centralize all power in the hands of the sovereign."

 DS_VARIANT_03:0 "§OPan-African Nationalism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§OPan-African Nationalism§! is a subset of Pan-Africanist thought that focuses on the nationalist aspect of Pan-African theory. Pan-African Nationalists seek to forge a unified African state based on common identity between African peoples, superseding tribal rivalries. This ideology is more common amongst black nationalist circles such as Garveyites in Hispaniola."

 DS_VARIANT_04:0 "§OPan-Arab Nationalism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§OPan-Arab Nationalism§! is a subset of Pan-Arabist thought emphasizing the nationalistic elements of the Arab unification movement. Pan-Arab Nationalists are not typically democratic, pushing for a united nationalist vanguard party with limited social reforms. They chiefly focus on industrialization and secularization of Arab society."

 DS_VARIANT_05:0 "§OTechnocratic Despotism§!"
 DS_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§OTechnocratic Despotism§! is a system of government by which the country is run in a non-democratic manner by technical or scientific specialists. Technocrats believe that democratic ideals are intrinsically against effective management of the government, and believe almost religiously in a form of scientific meritocracy."

 DS_VARIANT_06:0 "§OAuthoritarian Democracy§!"
 DS_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "§OAuthoritarian Democracy§! is a system of government where democracy is conducted by the ruling elite of an authoritarian state in an effort to represent the varying interests of a society. In most cases, this manifests as a form of managed democracy wherin candidates are managed and approved by the ruling government to prevent the manifestation of any anti-government leadership."

 DS_VARIANT_07:0 "§OBolivarian Democracy§!"
 DS_VARIANT_07_desc:0 "§OBolivarian Democracy§! is a unique system of government established under the Bolivarian Empire following the accession of Simon Bolivar as Emperor. Best described as a mix of German Constitutionalism and hegemonic democracy, Bolivarian Democracy is an enigmatic ideology often subject to the interpretations of its' adherents.\n\nDespite being undeniably authoritarian, Bolivarian Democracy has seen a wide variety of variation in policy. Populism has remained a key component of the ideology, being seen as the primary means by which the government maintains the support of Colombia's population."

 DS_VARIANT_08:0 "§ODominant Party Democracy§!"
 DS_VARIANT_08_desc:0 "§ODominant Party Democracy§! is a system of governance wherein a single party rules without major opposition, even without the need for laws to restrict said opposition.\n\n This party hegemony may be born out of genuine popularity, or it may be born from there simply being no notable alternatives. In many cases, however, dominant party democracies tend to be defined by corruption and intimidation tactics to maintain control."

 RC_VARIANT_01:0 "§OReactionary§!"
 RC_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§OReactionaries§! are a distinct form of hyper-conservatives focused on pseudo-authoritarian far right doctrines. Though not always overtly authoritarian, reactionary political parties will attempt to acquire and maintain power through authoritarian means. The ideology group is not particularly unified, however, and there are significant variances between different reactionary factions.\n\nReactionary groups can vary from simply militaristic conservatives to religious fundamentalists and monarchist cliques, but they share the unifying ideal of rolling back reforms in favor of tradition and dogma. They desire a return to the old days of their nation, and are extremely hostile towards anything that might prevent their restoration of these traditions."

 RC_VARIANT_02:0 "§OReligious Fundamentalism§!"
 RC_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§OReligious Fundamentalism§! is an ideology rooted in extreme devotion to clerical doctrine. Vehemently reactionary in regards to social change, religious fundamentalists court their supporters through a fanatical obsession with their particular sect. Fundamentalist states are often insular, but if goaded, will unleash their zealous population against enemies with a frenzied zeal that many ideologies simply cannot match."
 
 RC_VARIANT_03:0 "§OEthno-Nationalism§!"
 RC_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§OEthno-Nationalism§! is a form of nationalism which is defined by an ethnic group, common language or culture. Ethno-Nationalists typically promote assimilation into the preferred culture and can, in extreme circumstances, promote the superiority of their culture in a similar manner to Neo-Imperialists."

 RC_VARIANT_04:0 "§ODominant Party Democracy§!"

 CN_VARIANT_01:0 "§OConservative§!"
 CN_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§OConservatism§! is a prevalent ideology in many nations, advocating for traditionalism and moderate reforms. Conservatives are often dramatically more moderate than their more reactionary counterparts and are far less hostile to reform. Many advocate for slower, steady reforms rather than the dramatic changes purposed by Liberals and State Socialists. \n\nFavoring a mixture of traditional social roles and free market reforms, conservativism is an almost universally prevalent ideology."
 
 CN_VARIANT_02:0 "§ORight Wing Populism§!"
 CN_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§ORight Wing Populism§! is, unsurprisingly, a strain of conservative thought that caters more to the masses. While left wing populism may often emphasize the economic element, right wing populism tends to focus on a mix of cultural preservationism and anti-elitist doctrine.\n\nThe line between progressive conservatism and right wing populism can sometimes become blurred, as in some cases either may adopt economically progressive policies while not necessarily being left wing. In either case, there is a general emphasis on appealing to the common man over national elites."

 CN_VARIANT_03:0 "§OProgressive Conservatism§!"
 CN_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§OProgressive Conservatism§! is a relatively old ideology, finding roots in the Enlightenment era. Progressive Conservatism has been a major driving force behind historic reformist movements, most notably the British push to abolish slavery.\n\nIn many cases, Progressive Conservatives push social reforms and economic policies that would traditionally be seen as left wing or liberal, while maintaining some regressive cultural norms. In some cases, this might manifest as a means to undermine socialist support through competitive welfare policies that pull votes from left wing candidates. In other cases, it might be as unremarkable as a party which maintains conservative fiscal policies while pushing social reforms."

Advocating for social and economic reforms, Liberal factions are found in nearly every democracy on Earth. Liberal factions are, as their name implies, more socially liberal than other ideological groups. Many favour the introduction of suffrage for different racial groups and women.\n\nLiberals are commonplace throughout Europe, and have played pivotal roles in pushing for social liberalization in the grand empires of the continent. While not as revolutionary as it once might have been, Liberalism is still a strong force around the world in the fight for equality."

 AN_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§OAnarcho-Liberalism§! is an ideology strictly focused on free market capitalism. Either representing business friendly factions or factions outright run by businesses, Anarcho-Liberals are an occasionally authoritarian group with a pure focus on acquisition of capital. From the Zaibatsus of the former Japanese Empire to the British East India Company, Anarcho-Liberal factions are commonplace in nations with a focus on so-called Empire Capitalism.\n\nThough deeply disliked by most leftists, Anarcho-Liberals find their support in the boardrooms and businesses of many empires, and will often do anything in their power to continue acquisition of capital."

 SS_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "§OState Socialism§!, often called Bismarckian Socialism, is an ideology of moderate Socialists emulating the welfare policies of Bismarckian Germany. Though the term was used by Bismarck's enemies to mock his policies, many began to use it as a general term for policies similar to those he implemented. State Socialists are sometimes revolutionary socialists, but are not quite as extreme as Jacobins. Many advocate for democratic socialist ideas, such as the creation of welfare states and encouragement of worker's rights. Others are more extreme, such as Bukuninists that push for more Anarcho-Collectivist ideas.\n\nRegardless of specifics, with the continuing march of industrialization, State Socialists will always find their support in the factories and unions of many nations."

 SS_VARIANT_02:0 "§OBakuninist Collectivism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_02_desc:0 "§OBakuninist Collectivism§! was developed largely as a reaction to the rise of Jacobinism. Developed by Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin, Collectivism rejected the idea of a revolutionary vanguard proposed my most Jacobin theorists. Instead, Bakunin proposed the idea of an nearly stateless society, operating via direct democracy. In the wake of the bloody postwar Jacobin revolutions, many disenchanted socialists embraced Bakuninist Collectivism and its' ideals of revolutionary democracy and worker's self management."

 SS_VARIANT_03:0 "§OReformist Socialism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§OReformist Socialism§! differs from other forms of state socialism by its explicit denial of revolution as a meaningful way towards socialism. Instead, it proposes that socialism can only be brought to the masses by the ballot. Through the democratic process, how much it may favour capitalists, reform can be born and change can be made."

 SS_VARIANT_04:0 "§OAgrarian Socialism§!"
 SS_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§OAgrarian Socialism§! is a strain of socialism that seeks to combine the socialist goal of seizing the means of production with the rural way of life. Agrarian socialism explicitly rejects the urban and progressive dominance of most socialist movements and instead opts for agrarian lifestyles, including a more localized and traditionalist response to socialism. In general, the agrarian socialist movement prefers a bottom up approach to socialism, instead of the top down state-interventionism of most socialist movements."

 JC_VARIANT_01:0 "Jacobinism"
 JC_VARIANT_01_desc:0 "Jacobinism is a school of thought that originated in the French Reformation. Originally espoused by Robespierre, modern Jacobins argue for the abolition of all hierachy, not just monarchy. Their principle concern is the creation of a direct democacy, often alongside the creation of a revolutionary vanguard to protect said democracy. In reality, however, this often leads to a far-left authoritarian government. Though progressive socially, Jacobin states are often despotic and militaristic, seeking to spread their revolution abroad.\n\nJacobins foster their support in the poor and defenseless, seeking to galvanize them to overturn the many crowns that pepper the Earth, bringing revolution worldwide."

 JC_VARIANT_03_desc:0 "§ORevolutionary Imperialism§! is a radical, militant offshoot of Jacobinism arguing for the continued spread of the people's revolution. Revoultionary Imperialists seek to expand into surrounding nations and beyond, creating sister republics dedicated to their liberators' revolutionary ideals. Even among other Jacobins, Revolutionary Imperialists are seen as dangerous radicals, not just for their militancy but their tendency to gain traction within revolutionary militaries."

 JC_VARIANT_04:0 "§ONational Jacobinism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_04_desc:0 "§ONational Jacobinism§! is the term given to the rightist branch of Jacobin thought. Originating out of Germany, National Jacobinism grew as a rejection of French Classical Jacobinism, which was a distinctly liberal ideology. National Jacobins, instead, appeal to the militaristic and more socially conservative members of society. While still arguing for revolutionary republicanism, National Jacobins are against social reformism and believe in the importance of maintaining societal norms. In this way, National Jacobins are socially reactionary but economically collectivist. In many ways, the militant conservative nature of National Jacobins is more comparable to Neo Imperialist thought than Classical or even Reformist Jacobinist thought."
 
 JC_VARIANT_05:0 "§OClassical Jacobinism§!"
 JC_VARIANT_05_desc:0 "§OClassical Jacobinism§! is an offshoot of traditional Jacobin thought that rejects the vanguardism and political tutelage of more conventional Jacobinism. Classical Jacobinism advocates for the idea of \"Revolutionary Democracy\", under which the majority of power is decentralized among the population and executive power is kept controlled via checks and balances. Though denounced by conventional Jacobins for the rejection of the vanguard, Classical Jacobins remain a prominent offshoot of Revolutionary Republican thought."

 JC_VARIANT_06:0 "§OKingoro Hashimoto Thought§!"
 JC_VARIANT_06_desc:0 "§OKingoro Hashimoto Thought§! is a branch of Revolutionary Republican thought unique to the Japanese Republic. Coined by dictatorial leader Kingoro Hashimoto, Hashimoto Thought combines elements of Japanese martial values with left wing populism and revolutionary republican ideas.\n\nOriginally conceived as a means to justify his seizure of power, Hashimoto has crafted his ideology into something uniquely Japanese. Simultaneously nationalist and internationalist, decrying monarchy yet defending dictatorship, Kingoro-Hashimoto Thought is very much a product of its' environment."

 JC_VARIANT_07:0 "§OSocial Banditry§!"
 JC_VARIANT_07_desc:0 "§OSocial Banditry§! imitates the beliefs of Robin Hood, steal from the rich and give to the poor. However, this ideology requires the state to effectively always be hostile with all of its neighbours. Conducting raids, robbing banks, and any other avenue of gaining wealth to fund the state.\n\nThere is no real government to speak of and the state completely relies on its army, in the form of gangs to administer the nation in any capacity."
