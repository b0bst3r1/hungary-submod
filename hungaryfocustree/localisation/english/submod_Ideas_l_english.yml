Citing Hungary's claims on Croatia, the Hungarian Revolutionary Army moved in to openly support Croatian forces in the region in 1914. This saw the establishment of the §RCroatian People's Republic, a sister Republic§! to the one in Budapest and heavily reliant on local Hungarian advisors and economic support. A significant portion of our military is dedicated to supporting the Croatian forces, drawing some resources away from other sectors." 
  HUN_diverse_general_staff:0 "Diverse General Staff"
  HUN_diverse_general_staff_desc:0 "Hungarian General Staff is made up of representatives of various political views ranging from §RJacobinism§! to §GRadical Nationalism§!. Although Jacobinism is against nationalism and believes in internationalism Hungary cannot repress such Generals, as this would be a huge blow to the whole army. Also many militaries take the position of §BState Socialism§! and do not support the current party line advocating the introduction of market reforms. \n\n§RAll this is incredibly divide for the Hungarian Common Republic and calls into question its existence.§!" 
  BOS_patriotic_war:0 "Bosnian Patriotic War"
  BOS_patriotic_war_desc:0 "Bosnia has been under the control of foreign goverments for centuries. The people have been enslaved by foreign overlords. Turkey, Serbia, Croatia and, until recently, Hungary did not allow the Bosnian people to live freely. \n\nNow that Bosnia is finally independent, the invaders are encroaching on Bosnian territory again. This is an ideal chance for the Bosnian people. We must not find ourselves again under foreign domination. \n\n§RThere can be no peaceful coexistence between the Islamic faith and non-Islamic society and political institutions.§!"

Their allegiance to Germany had cost nearly a million lives, economic collapse and reduced much of the nation to near famine conditions. The touchpaper of Revolution was easily lit in 1912, when the Royal Hungarian Army attempted to crack down on protests in Budapest.\n\nVeteran's militias, trained and hardened by fighting on the Romanian and North Italian fronts, quickly turned the tables on the pro-German protectorate government. Within a matter of days, the nation descended into civil war and revolutionary violence. The regime that emerged from the revolution would be one founded not on Imperial obligations or bourgeois capitalism, but on revolutionary republicanism. Hungary is the vanguard of the revolution in the Balkans, and her people are dedicated to the ideas upon which the new republic was founded."
