However the independence was only nominal. Karl Ludwig of Habsburg would become the King of Hungary and maintain loyalty to the Habsburg family and subsequently to Germany. Hungary would continue to be an ally of Germany or rather in the eyes of the Hungarian people be a exploited puppet.\n\nThe Downfall of the Kingdom began with the outbreak of the §YGreat War§! in 1905 where the nation would immediatly join the Imperial Powers in their war against the Bourbons. The Hungarian People were dragged into a war they had no motivation or interest fighting in greatly increasing their dissent with the Royal Leadership. With Hungarian Soldiers being used as cannon fodder on the alpine front and the citiziens themself experiencing food shortages, the old Jacobine ideas born in 1790 would again gain support among the common people. In the end over 300 thousand soldiers would give their lives for the war effort and in the Treaty of Tours the Kingdom would only be awarded some small reperations as compensation. §RThe Spark was lit!§!\n\nThe following collapsing economy in 1911 would lead to bread riots which would escalate as Hungarian troops would fire on the protestors. From there on the situation rapidly escalated with Troops defecting on mass. §RThe Revolution§! had began, the Hungarian civil war between the Jacobin Revolutionaries and the German Backed Whites started. At the same time, Romanian guerrillas began to operate in Transylvania, but without decent support from Russia and the United Danubian Principalities they were suppressed. However despite these setback the Revolution would suceed under the guidance of Vilmos Böhm and the §YCommon Republic of Hungary§! would be declared on 6th March 1912.\n\nAfter several years of recovery from the Great War, foreign imperialists trying to bring Hungary back into their sphere of influence from all sides organized local skirmishes on the borders. Hungary immediately imposed martial law and mobilization in the state, whereupon the Great Powers retreated, fearing an escalation still unrecovered from the shock of the Great War. However its following and current problems would be internally. Ethnic tension in Slovakia and the Slavic border regions begin to cause issues, the ruling party §RForradalmi Tanács§! is splitting into two conflicting branches, the §YReformists§! and §YVanguardists§! and lastly the hero of the revolution Vilmos Böhm is losing his shine and motivation to rule this nation.

Tesla National Electricworks expands to enormous proportions, taking the Russian Empire to a new technological level. So ten years after the Great War, when the Russian Empire used Tesla's weapons against civilians, Nikola Tesla retreats into solitude. Though the reason for this is debated, many believe Tesla was deeply affected by the Great War and Revolutions, potentially even blaming himself for creating the weapons that Russian troops now used.\n\nOur community of scientists has long dreamed of the return of Nikola Tesla, and finally decided to write him a letter.

Practice showed that policies to stimulate population growth, while useful, did not solve the problem. As a result, a group of scientists, previously rejected by Hungary's scientific community, proposed a risky solution to the problem: the government was invited to invest in an accelerated augmentation program, so-called artificial humans. To develop this science to a degree that would minimize the likelihood of human deaths.\n\nDespite the fact that there have already been cases of augmentation in history. It comes out very expensive and more often than not does not justify itself. The challenge is to make the process cheaper and more accessible.\n\n§HStage 1:§! §OElectricity in Physiology§! is currently at §L[?HUN_revival_stage_one|%0]§!\n\n§HStage 2:§! §OExperiments to Revive the Heart§! is currently at §L[?HUN_revival_stage_two|%0]§! \n\n§HStage 3:§! §OExperiments to Revitalize the Body§! is currently at §L[?HUN_revival_stage_three|%0]§!\n\n§HStage 4:§! §OHuman Revitalization§! is currently at §L[?HUN_revival_stage_four|%0]§!\n\n§C*As your research progresses, you will receive new technologies.§!"

The second way is autonomization that is the establishment of autonomous regions with greater minority rights."
