The coming conflict has been predicted by nearly every advisor in every Balkan capital, and thus a palpable sense of tension has overtaken the region.

However the independence was only nominal. Karl Ludwig of Habsburg would become the King of Hungary and maintain loyalty to the Habsburg family and subsequently to Germany. Hungary would continue to be an ally of Germany or rather in the eyes of the Hungarian people be a exploited puppet.\n\nThe Downfall of the Kingdom began with the outbreak of the §YGreat War§! in 1905 where the nation would immediatly join the Imperial Powers in their war against the Bourbons. The Hungarian People were dragged into a war they had no motivation or interest fighting in greatly increasing their dissent with the Royal Leadership. With Hungarian Soldiers being used as cannon fodder on the alpine front and the citiziens themself experiencing food shortages, the old Jacobine ideas born in 1790 would again gain support among the common people. In the end over 300 thousand soldiers would give their lives for the war effort and in the Treaty of Tours the Kingdom would only be awarded some small reperations as compensation. §RThe Spark was lit!§!\n\nThe following collapsing economy in 1911 would lead to bread riots which would escalate as Hungarian troops would fire on the protestors. From there on the situation rapidly escalated with Troops defecting on mass. §RThe Revolution§! had began, the Hungarian civil war between the Jacobin Revolutionaries and the German Backed Whites started.
