  PB_SER_Alexander_I_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 4/12/1888\n\nAlexandar I, King of Serbia, who succeeded in conquering all the lands of so-called Greater Serbia and established it as a major European power for the first time in its history. In fact, a personal dictatorship of the monarch was established in the state, for which he was repeatedly criticised. Dependence on Russian resources and Romanian oil (which in fact also belongs to Russia) has also been established. But despite this, the people honour Aleksandar for his services to Serbia.\n\nOn the eve of the war, the political repression of the Jacobins is growing, religious propaganda is increasing and there is even talk of legalising the Chetniks. Local government newspapers are trying to stir up hatred between the peoples, to boost national morale. Sacrificing sovereignty, Serbia receives large investments from Russia in the military-industrial complex, as well as military trainers, so that the country is ready for war against revolutionary Hungary."
  
  SER_chetnik_issue:0 "The Chetnik Issue"
  SER_chetnik_issue_desc:0 "§RThe Chetniks§! is a Serbian royalist and nationalist movement and guerrilla force. They proved themselves during the wars with the Ottoman Empire as partisan units fighting for Serbian independence. The Chetniks are now recognised as a terrorist illegal organisation in Serbia, but nevertheless many of them actually serve in the Royal Serbian Army."
  SER_ethnic_conflicts:0 "Ethnic Conflicts"
  SER_ethnic_conflicts_desc:0 "The whole territory of the Kingdom of Serbia is inhabited by a huge number of peoples: Croats, Albanians, Bosniaks, Bulgarians. Among all these ethnic groups, the Serbs themselves are absolutely dominant and privileged, which obviously causes a new round of tension."
  SER_great_yug:0 "Dreams of a Greater Yugoslavia"
  SER_great_yug_desc:0 "Yugoslavism is an ideology supporting the notion that the South Slavs, namely the Bosniaks, Croats, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Serbs and Slovenes and Bulgarians, belong to a single Yugoslav nation separated by diverging historical circumstances, forms of speech, and religious divides. The idea of Yugoslavism has two main internal structural divisions, which have usually caused the movement to split. One faction seeks a centralised state and the assimilation of all nationalities into a single Yugoslav nationality. The other faction is in favour of a decentralised and multicultural federation that would preserve the existing differences of the peoples but promote their unity, while at the same time this faction is against the idea of centralisation and assimilation.\n\nDirectly in Serbia, the first faction is popular, but with some specificity. It implies that Serbia should seek to create a greater Yugoslav state under its rule, as this is the only way for the southern Slavs to secure their independence."
