Practice showed that policies to stimulate population growth, while helpful, but don't solve the problem. As a result, a group of scientists, previously rejected by Hungary's scientific community, proposed a risky solution to the problem: the government was invited to invest in a program to create so-called artificial humans, created by using electricity from the remains of people who had already died, to be used later for work. This is much cheaper than creating robots or something like that. \n\n§HStage 1:§! §OElectricity in Physiology§! is currently at §R[?HUN_revival_stage_one|%0]§! \n\n§HStage 2:§! §OExperiments to Revive the Heart§! is currently at §R[?HUN_revival_stage_two|%0]§! \n\n§HStage 3:§! §OExperiments to Revitalize the Body§! is currently at §R[?HUN_revival_stage_three|%0]§! \n\n§HStage 4:§! §OHuman Revitalization§! is currently at §R[?HUN_revival_stage_four|%0]§!"
